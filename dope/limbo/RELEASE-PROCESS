DOPE RELEASE PROCESS
This is still too much work:

 0. edit source code (compile and test)

 1. commit changes to cvs (commit messages should reflect changes)
 2. update doc/index.html (ChangeLog - this should be automated from cvs - perhaps use cvs2cl)

 3. build
	- source package (make distcheck)
	- compile linux binary static library
	- cross-compile win32 binary static library
 4. test (if test fails goto 0)

 5. cvs tag (f.e. cvs tag adic-0-0-8)
 6. upload packages to berlios
	- changelog again !
 7. upload source code documentation
